# WECHATY OFFICIAL EXAMPLES LIST DIRECTORY

The `wechaty-getting-started/examples` directory is provided for people who want to learn coding wechaty, for them to get an easier start. If you start coding wechaty for the first time, we highly recommend to start with the [ding-dong-bot.js](basic/ding-dong-bot.js), the best starter template for you.

| Filename         | Description | 描述 |
| ---              | ---         | ---         |
| ding-dong-bot.ts | The Best Starter Template for You | |

Moreover,

- All the other examples have been carefully arranged into different categories so as to better guide you for what to choose/see, as you move along.
- In order to keep things simple, we just put the examples in the subdirectory of the examples/ directory, so that they each can just run out-of-the-box.
- We also recommend that you at least read through them all, before starting coding, for a even better, smoother ride.
- More demos are welcome. If you have anything interesting to add, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Furthermore, after some careful thinking, the Wechaty author, Huan LI, feels it's necessary to add the examples as vanilla Javascript example, instead of Typescript ones. So if you want to contribute one, please consider so.
